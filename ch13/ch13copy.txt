WHY DOES THE SUN GO ON SHINING?
WHY DOES THE SEA RUSH TO SHORE?
DON'T THEY KNOW IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD
'CAUSE YOU DON'T LOVE ME ANYMORE?
WHY DO THE BIRDS GO ON SINGING?
WHY DO THE STARTS GLOW ABOVE?
DON'T THEY KNOW IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD

I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND I WONDER
WHY EVERYTHING IS THE SAME AS IT WAS
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND, NO, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW LIFE GOES ON THE WAY IT DOES!
WHY DOES MY HEART GO ON BEATING?
WHY DO THESE EYES OF MINE CRYING?
DON'T THEY KNOW IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD?
IT ENDED WHEN YOU SAID GOODBYE
